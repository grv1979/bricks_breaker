# AI Agent Instructions for BricksBreaker

This document provides guidance for AI coding agents working in this codebase. As the project evolves, please help maintain these instructions by documenting important patterns and decisions.

## Project Overview

BricksBreaker appears to be a new project. As an AI agent, please help establish and document:

- The core architecture and component structure as it emerges
- Key developer workflows and commands 
- Project-specific conventions and patterns
- Integration points and dependencies
- Testing and debugging approaches

## Documentation Guidelines

When working in this codebase:

1. Document any non-obvious patterns you discover while implementing features
2. Update build/test/debug instructions as new workflows are established
3. Add examples of project-specific conventions as they are defined
4. Note important architectural decisions and their rationale
5. Keep this guide concise and focused on actionable, project-specific guidance

## Current Status

This is a new project. As development progresses, AI agents should collaborate with developers to document:

- [ ] Core architecture overview
- [ ] Build and development setup
- [ ] Testing strategy and tools
- [ ] Deployment process
- [ ] Key conventions and patterns
- [ ] External integrations

AI agents: Please update this document as you learn more about the project structure and workflows. Focus on documenting discoverable patterns rather than aspirational practices.
